HEY THERE👋,

I'm Madelyn.  I began coding after a lifetime of interest with technology, which I've also explored with my work in the field of Curation in the Arts. 

👏 I have a passion for creating digital art experiences that insert users into invisible systems, and allow them to interact with those systems.  

🦾 I work in:
  -Python
  -Android
  more to come!
