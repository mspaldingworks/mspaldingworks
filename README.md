HEY THERE👋,

I'm Madelyn.  I began coding after a lifetime fascination with technology, which I've also explored with my work in the field of Curation in the Arts. 

I am a self-taught developer working in a number of languages, but predominantly Python and Kotlin-Java.

👏 I have a passion for creating digital art experiences that insert users into invisible systems, and allow them to interact with those systems. I'm not at the skill level needed to achieve my goals yet, but I am on the journey! 

🦾 I work in:
  
  -Android
  -Python
  -Wordpress, CSS, PHP, HTML
